	// URL of the page. This URL must begin with the protocol (such as http) and end with a trailing slash,

	Location string `xml:"loc"`

	// The date of last modification of the file. This date should be in W3C Datetime format.
	// This format allows you to omit the time portion, if desired, and use YYYY-MM-DD.
	//
	// Note that this tag is separate from the If-Modified-Since (304) header the server can return,
	// and search engines may use the information from both sources differently.
	LastModify string `xml:"lastmod,omitempty"`

	// How frequently the page is likely to change.
	// This value provides general information to search engines and may not correlate exactly to how often they crawl the page.
	// Valid values are:
	//
	// - always
	// - hourly
	// - daily
	// - weekly
	// - monthly
	// - yearly
	// - never
	//
	// The value "always" should be used to describe documents that change each time they are accessed.
	// The value "never" should be used to describe archived URLs.
	//
	// Please note that the value of this tag is considered a hint and not a command.
	// Even though search engine crawlers may consider this information when making decisions,
	// they may crawl pages marked "hourly" less frequently than that,
	// and they may crawl pages marked "yearly" more frequently than that.
	// Crawlers may periodically crawl pages marked "never" so that they can handle unexpected changes to those pages.
	ChangeFrequently string `xml:"changefreq,omitempty"`

	// The priority of this URL relative to other URLs on your site. Valid values range from 0.0 to 1.0.
	// This value does not affect how your pages are compared to pages on other sitesâ€”it only lets the search engines know which pages you deem most important for the crawlers.
	//
	// The default priority of a page is 0.5.
	//
	// Please note that the priority you assign to a page is not likely to influence the position of your URLs in a search engine's result pages.
	// Search engines may use this information when selecting between URLs on the same site,
	// so you can use this tag to increase the likelihood that your most important pages are present in a search index.
	//
	// Also, please note that assigning a high priority to all of the URLs on your site is not likely to help you.
	// Since the priority is relative, it is only used to select between URLs on your site.
	Priority float64 `xml:"priority,omitempty"`
